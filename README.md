## About the PDF Used

For development and demonstration purposes, this project uses a **publicly available financial report**.  
The PDF file is an official **financial statement released by a company that shares it publicly**, in accordance with transparency and disclosure policies. No confidential or private data is being used.

---

## Features

- Upload PDF financial statements  
- Extract data from PDFs using `pdf.js`  
- Calculate and display financial indicators (profitability ratios, performance metrics, etc.)  
- Generate visual reports using `Chart.js` (bar, pie, line, doughnut, and bubble charts)  
- Responsive layout with Bootstrap

## Technologies Used

- **HTML / CSS**  
- **Bootstrap** for responsive design  
- **JavaScript**  
- **pdf.js** for PDF parsing  
- **Chart.js** for interactive charts  
- **AI** assistance for learning, debugging, and optimizing chart generation

## Use of AI

I used AI to:

- Understand new programming concepts I wasnâ€™t familiar with  
- Debug my code when DevTools and browser debugging didnâ€™t lead to a solution  
- Help design and optimize chart rendering logic with Chart.js  

However, the **core logic for analyzing financial data, extracting it from PDFs, and calculating indicators** was developed by myself through **personal research and financial knowledge**, not with AI.

## Design Choices

The design of **Maximus Financial Analytics** focuses on clarity, professionalism, and ease of use. The homepage is clean and straightforward, guiding users immediately to upload their financial statement files for analysis. This simplicity supports users who want quick, reliable insights without distraction.

The color scheme is based on dark tones to convey seriousness and trust, using the following core colors defined in CSS variables:

- **Primary Color (`--primary-color: #010820`)**  
  A deep navy blue that establishes a strong, authoritative presence for primary interface elements and headers.

- **Accent Color (`--accent-color: #3498DB`)**  
  A vivid, modern blue used to draw attention to interactive components like buttons and highlights.

- **Secondary Color (`--secondary-color: #f5f5f5`)**  
  A soft, light gray ideal for supporting text, icons, and subtle UI details, enhancing readability.

- **Background Color (`--background-color: #111525`)**  
  A rich, dark indigo tone that creates a sleek and immersive backdrop for the entire interface.

These colors create a sleek, modern interface with high readability and professionalism.

> **Note:** The design and color styling of charts are currently a work in progress and will be refined in future updates.

## Responsiveness

The homepage and all its components are designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience across all devicesâ€”from desktops and laptops to tablets and smartphones.

Layouts adapt dynamically to different screen sizes, making it easy to upload files and view financial data wherever you are.

> **Note:** The chart designs are currently a work in progress and will be optimized for better responsiveness and clarity in future updates.
